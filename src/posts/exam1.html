    <h3>Section A Multiple Choice Questions Based on Short Reading Passages</h3>

    <div class="question">
      <h4>Passage One – The Quiet Power of Boredom (Questions 15–19)</h4>
      <p>
        When people complain that modern life is too busy, they usually mean that there are too many emails to answer, too many deadlines to meet and too many messages on their phones. Ironically, however, one of the rarest experiences in this age of constant stimulation is simple boredom. The moment a queue moves slowly or a train is delayed, most of us immediately reach for a screen. We treat boredom as if it were a tiny emergency that must be solved at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Psychologists are beginning to argue that this fear of boredom may be making our lives poorer rather than richer. In several experiments, researchers asked participants to sit alone in a quiet room with nothing to do for fifteen minutes. People reported that the time passed painfully slowly. Yet when they were later tested on creativity, those who had just endured boredom came up with more original ideas than people who had previously done a mildly interesting task. Boredom, it seems, is not the absence of activity but an invitation to direct our attention inward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, boredom was less common because many tasks were physically demanding. A farmer ploughing a field may have been tired or worried, but he rarely had the chance to say he was “bored”。 Today, by contrast, we are surrounded by forms of entertainment specifically designed to prevent even a moment of mental emptiness。 Streaming platforms automatically play the next episode; social media feeds refresh endlessly; news alerts interrupt us with minor updates。 Each small distraction takes the edge off boredom, but together they form a thick fog that can hide our deeper thoughts。
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not an argument for heroic self-denial。 There is nothing wrong with watching a funny video after a long day。 The problem arises when we become so unused to boredom that we never allow our minds to wander。 Some writers claim that their best ideas arrive when they are washing dishes or staring out of a window。 By refusing every dull minute, we may also be refusing the daydreams and questions that give direction to our lives。 A little boredom, carefully protected from the constant noise of devices, might be one of the most productive luxuries we still possess。
      </p>

      <p><strong>15.</strong> According to the passage, what is unusual in modern life?</p>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q15" value="A"> A) Having no access to entertainment。</label>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q15" value="B"> B) Feeling physically exhausted。</label>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q15" value="C"> C) Experiencing genuine boredom。</label>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q15" value="D"> D) Working under time pressure。</label>

      <p><strong>16.</strong> The experiments described in Paragraph 2 suggest that boredom may</p>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q16" value="A"> A) damage people’s memory。</label>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q16" value="B"> B) increase physical stress。</label>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q16" value="C"> C) reduce attention span。</label>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q16" value="D"> D) stimulate creative thinking。</label>

      <p><strong>17.</strong> The author mentions farmers in the past mainly to</p>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q17" value="A"> A) show that boredom is a new kind of emotion。</label>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q17" value="B"> B) contrast their working conditions with modern office work。</label>

      <h4>Passage Two – Remote Work and the Future of Cities (Questions 20–24)</h4>
      <p>
        Before 2020, working from home was a privilege enjoyed by a relatively small group of employees。 For many managers, the office was not just a place to sit at a desk; it was a symbol of control and cooperation。 When the pandemic forced companies around the world to adopt remote work almost overnight, the change was widely described as a “global experiment”。 Several years later, the results of that experiment are still being debated。
      </p>
      <p>
        On the one hand, surveys suggest that many workers value the flexibility remote work offers。 Without daily commuting, they gain extra hours that can be used for sleep, exercise or time with family。 Parents of young children, in particular, report that flexible schedules make it easier to stay in their jobs。 In some industries, companies have found that employees are just as productive—if not more so—when they are allowed to organize their own time。
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, cities built around daily commuting have begun to feel the impact of half-empty office towers。 Small cafés and restaurants that once depended on office workers for lunchtime business have struggled to survive。 Public transport systems, designed to carry huge crowds during rush hour, face financial pressure as passenger numbers fall。 Urban planners worry that if city centres become quiet for most of the week, the sense of shared public life may weaken。
      </p>
      <p>
        Some economists argue that this transformation also creates unexpected opportunities。 Empty office space can sometimes be converted into housing, helping to ease shortages in expensive cities。 If fewer people commute every day, air pollution and traffic congestion may decrease。 Smaller towns and rural areas can attract residents who no longer need to live near a headquarters building。 However, these benefits are unevenly distributed: workers who must be physically present—such as nurses, cleaners or delivery drivers—may see little improvement in their working conditions。
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the future of remote work is unlikely to be simply “at home” or “in the office”。 Many companies are experimenting with hybrid models, asking staff to come in on certain days for meetings and teamwork while allowing quiet tasks to be done elsewhere。 The success of these arrangements will depend not only on technology but also on trust。 If employers use digital tools mainly to monitor every click and keystroke, the promise of flexibility may quickly turn into a new form of surveillance。

    <div class="question">
      <h4>Passage Three – Counting Birds, Changing Minds (Questions 25–29)</h4>
      <p>
        Every January, thousands of ordinary people across the world step into their gardens, parks or balconies with a pair of binoculars and a notebook。 For one hour, they record every bird they can see and send the results to a central database。 This simple activity, known as a “citizen science” bird count, has become an important source of information for ecologists trying to understand how wildlife responds to climate change and urbanisation。
      </p>
      <p>
        From a scientific point of view, the method has both strengths and weaknesses。 On the positive side, it allows researchers to collect data from millions of locations that would otherwise be impossible to visit。 Patterns emerge when records from many years are compared: some species are appearing earlier in spring; others are gradually moving northwards; some are disappearing entirely from certain regions。 On the negative side, volunteers vary in their skill and enthusiasm。 One person may correctly identify a rare warbler, while another may mistake it for a common sparrow。
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet many scientists argue that the social benefits of citizen science are at least as important as the data it produces。 Taking part in a bird count encourages people to pay close attention to their local environment, noticing details that might otherwise be ignored—a song from a rooftop, a flash of colour in a hedge。 Participants often report that their sense of connection to nature increases after the event。 Some go on to join conservation groups or to campaign for better protection of green spaces in their neighbourhoods。
      </p>
      <p>
        Critics worry that governments may use the popularity of citizen science as an excuse to reduce funding for professional research。 Organising large-scale surveys, they point out, still requires trained staff, careful planning and long-term analysis。 Nevertheless, even the critics rarely suggest abandoning public involvement altogether。 In a time when many people spend much of their day looking at screens, asking them to spend one hour looking at the sky may be a small but meaningful step towards a more informed and engaged society。
      </p>

      <p><strong>25.</strong> What is the main purpose of the bird-count activity described in Paragraph 1?</p>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q25" value="A"> A) To entertain families during winter holidays。</label>

      <label><input type="radio" name="q25" value="D"> D) To teach children how to use binoculars。</label>

      <p><strong>26.</strong> One weakness of citizen science mentioned in the passage is that</p>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q26" value="A"> A) volunteers sometimes disagree with government policies。</label>

      <label><input type="radio" name="q26" value="D"> D) it is too expensive to organise。</label>

    <!-- Section B Short Answer -->
    <h3>Section B Short Answer Questions Based on a Long Reading Passage</h3>
    <div class="question">
      <h4>Passage – Learning to Live Alone (SAQ1–SAQ5)</h4>
      <p>
        When Li Yan told her parents that she wanted to rent a small apartment and live alone, they were surprised。 In their generation, moving out before marriage was rare and sometimes even seen as a sign of family conflict。 But for Li Yan, who works in a busy design firm in Shanghai, living alone represents independence rather than distance。 After sharing crowded dormitories and noisy flats for almost a decade, she longed for a quiet space that was entirely her own。
      </p>
      <p>
        The rise of single-person households is not unique to China。 In many large cities around the world, from Stockholm to São Paulo, more and more people are choosing—or being forced by circumstances—to live alone。 Some are young professionals like Li Yan; others are elderly widows, recent divorcees or migrants whose families are far away。 This trend worries some commentators, who fear that societies built on individual apartments behind locked doors will become colder and less cooperative。
      </p>
      <p>
        Researchers who study loneliness warn that living alone and being lonely are not the same thing。 A person can feel desperately isolated in a crowded home, while another may enjoy a solitary evening with a book and a pot of tea。 Surveys suggest that what matters most is not the number of people in a household but the quality of relationships outside it。 Those who have close friends, participate in community activities or feel valued at work are less likely to report serious loneliness, even if they sleep in an empty flat。
      </p>
      <p>
        For Li Yan, creating a sense of connection requires deliberate effort。 She keeps in touch with former classmates through group chats, has dinner with her parents every Sunday, and volunteers at a weekend art class for children in her neighbourhood。 These routines not only give structure to her week but also make her more attentive when she returns to her own apartment。 She says that doing the dishes or watering her plants after a long day now feels strangely satisfying instead of boring。
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, living alone poses practical challenges。 Rent is high, and there is no one to share the bills if she loses her job。 When she caught a bad cold last winter, she had to order medicine online and make herself porridge, which took twice as long as simply asking a roommate for help。 She jokes that learning to live alone has taught her a set of unexpected “adult skills”: fixing a dripping tap with online tutorials, reading contracts carefully before signing them, and planning her shopping so that food does not go to waste。
      </p>
      <p>
        Some sociologists see the growth of one-person households as part of a broader shift in values。 In the past, adulthood was often defined by a series of shared milestones—marriage, parenthood, a lifelong job。 Now, they argue, individuals are being encouraged to design their own biographies, collecting experiences rather than status symbols。 For better or worse, living alone has become one of the ways in which people try to answer the question: “What kind of life do I want to build?”
      </p>

      <p><strong>说明：</strong>每题答案不超过 3 个词。</p>

      <p><strong>SAQ1.</strong> For Li Yan, living alone mainly symbolizes <input type="text" id="SAQ1" class="small-input" placeholder="≤3 words">。</p>

For teenagers, this may sound like paradise: you can buy snacks at midnight, stream movies until dawn, and still have a package delivered before breakfast. But doctors warn that this culture of constant availability comes at a cost. Young people who regularly sleep fewer than seven hours a night are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. Their memory becomes less reliable, and they find it hard to concentrate in class. Researchers suggest that families should agree on a digital 'curfew': after a certain time, phones and laptops are kept out of the bedroom. Turning off screens at least an hour before bed helps the brain slow down and prepares the body for deep, refreshing sleep, which in turn protects their health.";
